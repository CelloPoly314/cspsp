This is a homebrew game for the Sony PSP, originally based on Valve's popular
Counter-Strike. It's a 2d overhead (top-down) shooter that features team and 
free-for-all gameplay with a variety of weapons, all within a fully functional
multiplayer component.

Remember to visit the official site and the forums, where you can discuss 
anything about the game, submit bug reports and suggestions, and download maps 
and other content made by the community.
