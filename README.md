CSPSP is a homebrew game for the Sony PSP, created in 2006 and updated through 2011. It is a 2d top-down shooter heavily based on Counter-Strike, with similar round-based team gameplay and weapon selection. It features fully multiplayer gameplay via community-hosted servers.

Now we have a PC build! - see the [Releases](https://github.com/CelloPoly314/cspsp/releases) page.
